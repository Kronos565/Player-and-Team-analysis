# Players and Team Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of players to uncover insights about salary distribution, team strategies, and player demographics. The dataset contains information on players' teams, positions, ages, salaries, and other attributes. Through data analysis and visualization, key trends, correlations, and insights are identified to provide a deeper understanding of how salaries are distributed and how teams allocate their resources.

## Features

1. **Employee Distribution Across Teams**  
   - Determined the number of players in each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total.  
   - Visualized team distribution with a bar chart.

2. **Segregation of Employees by Positions**  
   - Analyzed player positions across teams to identify role distributions.  
   - Visualized positions using a pie chart for better clarity.

3. **Analysis of Predominant Age Groups**  
   - Grouped players into age categories: `Young (22-24)`, `Middle-aged (25-29)`, and `Senior (30+)`.  
   - Identified the predominant age group with a bar chart.

4. **Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position**  
   - Calculated total salary expenditures across teams and positions to find which team and role spent the most.  
   - Presented results using a grouped bar chart for clarity.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**  
   - Investigated and visualized the relationship between player age and salary using a scatter plot and a line chart.  
   - Highlighted a weak positive correlation between age and salary.

## Insights

- **Team and Player Distribution:**  
  Teams with more players have diverse salary expenditures and allocate budgets differently.  

- **Predominant Age Group:**  
  Most players fall into the `25-29` age range, indicating that teams prioritize players in their prime.  

- **Salary Expenditures:**  
  High-value roles like **PG** and **SG** dominate salary expenditures, reflecting their critical impact on team performance.  

- **Age vs. Salary Correlation:**  
  While there is a slight positive correlation, salary is influenced more by player role and performance than age.

## Limitations

- The analysis focuses only on salary, age, team, and position, leaving out performance metrics that could add further insights.
- The dataset assumes equal weight for each player's contribution without factoring in specific achievements or contracts.
